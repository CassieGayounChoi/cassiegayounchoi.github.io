### **2. Goal**

  + Predicting behavior to retain customers.
  + Analyzing all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs to understand customer demographics and buying behavior.
  + Using predictive analytics to analyze the most profitable customers and how they interact.
  + Taking targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

<br>

### **3. Methodology & Summary**

  + The dataset, derived from IBM Marketing Data, aims to predict customer value using regression and machine learning models. The main objective is to predict customer behaviors to bolster retention. Comprehensive analysis of the customer data aids in tailoring retention programs based on specific demographics and purchasing habits. Moreover, predictive analytics were employed to deeply understand the interactions of the most profitable customers. Specific strategic actions were then initiated to enhance the engagement and growth of these profitable customers.

  + During the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis phase, the dataset was found to be complete with no missing values. Our modeling strategy encompassed three types of linear regression models: one with the original customer value, another with a log-transformed customer value, and the third with a square-root transformed customer value. Additionally, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models were employed for predictions.

  + In terms of model evaluation, the RMSE was the primary metric of performance. While the log-transformed and square-root transformed models exhibited a lower RMSE, they were discarded due to violations of key modeling assumptions. Ultimately, the Random Forest model, displaying the lowest RMSE without any assumption breaches, was selected as the final model.
